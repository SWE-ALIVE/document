\begin{abstract}
Smart home provides automated control and convenience in home environments. Although smart homes have improved convenience in daily life, their rigid and uniform structures limit customization and integration of diverse information sources, leading to passive and inflexible management systems. We propose a new multi-turn AI based Chat Room system, AIfred, which enables users to manage and control home appliances. With AIfred, users can register home appliances directly or import them from compatible apps, allowing them to create custom chat rooms for seamless device management. Through our appliance chat rooms, users can identify the most suitable appliances for specific situations and execute them simultaneously, simplifying the process of smart home control. Users can efficiently manage and control their appliances at any time through the chat interface. Furthermore, we've integrated a human feedback mechanism to improve the system. Users can evaluate their experience after the end of process, providing valuable insights for continuous enhancement of the application. This data is systematically stored and utilized for learning and refining the system's performance. AIfred represents a significant step forward in smart home technology, addressing the need for more flexible, user-centric solutions in the evolving landscape of home automation.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1)] The Advancement of AI Technology and the Rise of Multi-Agent Systems \\ \\
     Artificial intelligence technology has been developing at an astonishing rate over the past few years. In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeating the world's top Go player marked the beginning of the AI era. Since then, AI technology has become even more sophisticated, with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 ushering in the era of generative AI. ChatGPT reached 1 million users within a week of its launch and saw explosive growth, surpassing 100 million active users in just two months.

    \hspace{1em} In 2023, GPT-4 was released, showcasing even more advanced features. GPT-4 evolved into a multimodal model that can simultaneously process various input data such as text, images, audio, and video, utilizing a dataset about 500 times larger than its previous model. These advancements reflect a broader trend in AI development, where the technology is moving beyond simple content generation to more complex, interactive, and adaptive capabilities.
    
    \hspace{1em} The future of the AI industry points to evolve from generative models to autonomous agents, ushering in an era of multi-agents where multiple agents collaborate, think, and learn independently. This evolution will likely lead to the integration of multi-agent systems within the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), which combines AI and the Internet of Things (IoT), and is expected to spread to various industries, centered around manufacturing. \\

    \item [2)] IoT Technology Market Trends and the Current Status of Smart Homes  \\ \\
    The spread of IoT technology is dramatically changing all aspects of daily life, with `smart homes' being a prime example. In smart homes, home appliances and various devices are interconnected via the internet, allowing users to control them remotely and automate daily tasks.  The smart appliance market continues to grow rapidly, fueled by increasing consumer interest in convenience, energy efficiency, and personalized living environments. 

    \hspace{1em} Despite widespread awareness and adoption of smart home devices, many users are not fully utilizing their potential. Over Half of users (53.1\%) still rely on basic functions like power control and status monitoring, while advanced capabilities such as automation or device interlinking remain underutilized. This indicates a gap between the technology's capabilities and how users engage with it, suggesting a need for more intuitive interfaces and seamless integration to encourage deeper interaction.
    
    \hspace{1em} As smart home technology continues to evolve, there is a growing opportunity to move beyond simple control features and offer more intelligent, adaptive experiences that anticipate users' needs. The next step for smart homes involves leveraging AI to enable dynamic collaboration among devices, creating environments that actively respond to user behavior and preferences.
    
    \hspace{1em} Our team's goal is to push the boundaries of smart home technology by advancing from passive AI systems to dynamic and intelligent interactions. We aim to deliver optimal results for users by implementing the ability for smart devices to communicate with each other using Large Language Models (LLMs). Through this solution, we aim to address the current gap between the potential of smart home technology and its real-world use to increase access and smoothness to advanced automation, ultimately improving the daily life experience of individual users.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [a.] Need for improved Customization and Differentiated User Experience \\ \\
    According to the Smart Home Trend Report 2023, major dissatisfaction factors for smart home appliances include `lack of additional functions when using devices in conjunction'. The response `lack of additional functions when using devices in conjunction' suggests that users are not fully utilizing the functions of smart home appliances. In fact, while smart appliances offer various functions through applications, customer satisfaction is declining as users fail to effectively utilize these functions. This indicates the need for improved Customization and User Experience so that users can effectively use them. \\ 
    
    \item [b.] Limited and Uniform Scenarios \\ \\ 
    While the current routine functions of smart appliances are useful for automating users' daily patterns, they have limitations in responding to complex and diverse real-life scenarios. For example, in situations with many variables such as sudden weather changes, pre-set routines alone are insufficient for appropriate responses. Moreover, it's difficult to flexibly handle complex interactions between various appliances or immediate changes in user demands. Therefore, for a truly smart home solution, more advanced technologies such as real-time situation awareness and machine learning are needed. This requires the development of intelligent systems that can understand users' living patterns more deeply and respond according to the situation. \\
    
    \item [c.] Limitations of Passive and Individual Management \\ \\
    Despite being labeled as `smart', current smart home appliances still heavily rely on passive and individual management by users. In most cases, users need to adjust settings for each device separately and make judgments and decisions for various situations directly. For example, user intervention is required in many aspects such as adjusting the air conditioner's temperature, selecting the washing machine's cycle, or setting the robot vacuum's cleaning schedule. Furthermore, even in routine settings, users have to perform logical structure design themselves, which can lead to logical errors. This indicates that the focus is on the independent operation of each device rather than on device interconnection and overall home environment optimization.\\
    
    \item [d.] Lack of Information Integration \\ \\
    Smart home applications individually offer rich features and information. Each app provides useful data such as energy usage monitoring, device status checks, and even general lifestyle information. However, these diverse information and functions are not connected into a single integrated system, which limits the user experience. As a result, users must open each section separately to check information and make their own judgments to decide on their next actions based on this information. This hinders the convenience and efficiency of smart homes, causing users the inconvenience of having to manually integrate and analyze multiple pieces of information.
    
\end{itemize} 


\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [a.] Providing Customized Services and improving user Experience \\ \\ 
    It is necessary to improve the user experience by providing customized services that meet user needs. This can be achieved by using AI to provide user-customized interfaces and improve user experience through more user interactions.

    \hspace{1em} Specifically, in this system, when the user simply instructs a task via chat or voice, AI coordinates the `conversation' between home appliances to derive the optimal execution plan. It obtains user confirmation before execution, suggests alternatives based on changing situations, and learns user preferences. It also collects feedback after task completion for continuous improvement.
    
    \hspace{1em} This approach goes beyond simply controlling devices, providing a true smart home experience that deeply understands and reflects the user's intentions and values. As a result, users can enjoy a home environment perfectly tailored to their lifestyle and preferences without complex settings, making the interaction between technology and humans more natural and efficient.\\
    
    \item [b.] AI-based Integrated Control and Scenario Optimization \\ \\
    LLM (Large Language Model) technology can generate and analyze various complex scenarios. Based on tasks instructed by users via chat or voice, LLM can establish comprehensive preparation plans.
    
    For example, with just the simple information that ``friends are coming over tonight," LLM can establish a comprehensive preparation plan including lighting settings, indoor temperature adjustment, music playback, and activating cleaning robots. In this process, LLM suggests optimal solutions considering the user's past preferences, current situation, and energy efficiency.
    
    \hspace{1em} If changes are needed during execution, LLM immediately generates alternatives and provides options to the user. Additionally, by analyzing feedback collected after task completion, it can provide better solutions in similar situations in the future. In this way, LLM acts as an intelligent mediator between users and appliances, contributing to more accurately understanding and realizing the user's intentions.\\
    
    \item [c.] Integrated Control Between Devices and Adaptation to Changing Environments \\ \\ 
    The optimization of environment-adaptive scenarios through integrated control systems and collaboration between products greatly enhances the efficiency and user experience of smart homes. Each device performs status checks and transmissions, and the central control system monitors this and comprehensively analyzes data collected from each device.
    
    \hspace{1em} Based on this, dynamic adjustments between devices are made according to changing environmental conditions (e.g., weather changes, indoor air quality, user activity patterns). For example, when the temperature rises, the air conditioner and blinds can work together to efficiently maintain indoor temperature, or the air purifier and ventilation system can be linked to create an optimal indoor air environment.
    
    \hspace{1em} This system maintains the optimal living environment continuously with minimal user intervention and can flexibly respond to unpredictable situations, thus implementing a smart home in the true sense of the term. Furthermore, by entrusting logical structure design to AI, it can solve the problem of logical errors that may occur when users set it directly.\\
    
    \item [d.] Integration of IoT Technology and Information \\ \\
    Integrating and utilizing the diverse information and functions provided by IoT devices greatly improves the efficiency of smart home systems. Current smart home appliances, i.e., IoT devices, offer a wide variety of convenient functions, but users are not fully utilizing them.
    
    \hspace{1em} To solve this problem, we propose managing various lifestyle information such as energy consumption, indoor environmental data, user schedules, and weather information provided by apps comprehensively on a single platform. This integrated information is used for smarter decision-making by home appliances.
    
    \hspace{1em} For example, a washing machine can analyze the user's schedule and power usage patterns to suggest optimal operating times. This integrated approach enables complex scenario settings that optimize the entire home environment, going beyond simple automation of individual devices.
    
    \hspace{1em} As a result, users can enjoy a more convenient and energy-efficient smart home experience. Additionally, it allows users to easily obtain information and maximize the interaction effect with IoT devices and, by extension, with the smart home.
